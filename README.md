About the Project

This project analyzes food donation listings to help NGOs optimize pickup scheduling and reduce food waste. It predicts food freshness and the likelihood of successful collection, enabling better decision-making for time-sensitive donations.

A Streamlit dashboard is used to present analytics and provide real-time predictions in an easy-to-use interface.
